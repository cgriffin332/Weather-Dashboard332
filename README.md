# Weather-Dashboard332

## Description

In this project, I have created a weather dashboard where the user can enter the name of a city in the search bar and receive the current weather as well as the 5-day forecast. This application uses OpenWeather API to retrieve the information and stores the last searched city in local storage. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Usage

When the webpage loads, the user is presented with an empty weather dashboard and a search input.

When the user submits a search city they are presented with the current weather conditions including city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The background-color of the UV Index represents the level of severity including Green(low), Yellow(moderate), Orange(high), Red(very high), and Violet(extreme). The user is also presented with the 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

Each time the user searches a new city, it appears underneath the search-bar and becomes their search history.

When the user clicks on one of the cities in their search history, that city's weather information is displayed onto the page.

If the user refreshes the page, their search history will be removed, but they will be presented with the last searched city forecast.
